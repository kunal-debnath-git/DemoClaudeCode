## Summary of Claude Code Features

### Managing Project Memory

**`/init`**: Claude Code scans your codebase and creates `CLAUDE.md` file inside your project directory.

`CLAUDE.md` guides Claude through your codebase, pointing out important commands, architecture and coding style. It's automatically included in the context each time you launch Claude Code. Here's an example of a `CLAUDE.md` file generated by init for the RAG chatbot example.

**`#`**: Use `#` to quickly add a memory. Useful when you see Claude Code repeats an error.

**Example 1:** Since the project is a uv project, we added these to `CLAUDE.md` file using `#`:

```text
#use uv to run python files or add any dependencies
```

**Example 2:** You can inform Claude Code about the database schema. In this case since you have a vector database, you can inform Claude Code about the collections stored in the vector database:

```text
#The vector database has two collections:

course_catalog:
  - stores course titles for name resolution
  - metadata for each course: title, instructor, course_link, lesson_count, lessons_json (list of lessons: lesson_number, lesson_title, lesson_link)

course_content:
  - stores text chunks for semantic search
  - metadata for each chunk: course_title, lesson_number, chunk_index
```

### Summary of Claude Code Commands

| Command | Description |
| ------- | ----------- |
| `/clear` | Clears current conversation history |
| `/compact` | Summarizes current conversation history |
| `ESC` | Interrupt Claude to redirect or correct it |
| `ESC ESC` | Rewind the conversation to an earlier point in time |
| `@` | Mention files with `@` to include its content in your request |
| `/mcp` | Manage MCP connection & check available MCP servers with their provided tools |

> You can use regular bash commands within Claude Code, but you need to start the command with `!` (for example: `!pwd`). You can type `exit` to quit Claude Code.

### Shortcuts

| Shortcut | Description |
| -------- | ----------- |
| `Shift+Tab` | Switch between planning and auto-accept mode |
| `Cmd+Shift+Ctrl+4` (Mac) / `Win+Shift+S` (Windows) | Take a screenshot |
| `Ctrl+V` | Paste a screenshot (might not work on Windows) |

## Additional Claude Features

### Extended Thinking Mode

For complex tasks (e.g., complex architectural changes, debugging complicated issues), you can use the word "think" to trigger extended thinking mode. There are several levels of thinking:

`"think"` < `"think hard"` < `"think harder"` < `"ultrathink"`

Each level allocates more thinking budget for Claude.

### Use of Subagents

You've learned that one of the out-of-the-box tools for Claude Code is **Task**, which Claude Code can use to launch subagents for complex multi-step tasks. You can explicitly ask Claude Code to use subagents to brainstorm ideas or to investigate multiple aspects of a question or a problem you want to solve. These built-in agents are of general purpose.

You can also create your customized specialized subagents. Each subagent has its own context window, and you can define a custom system prompt and specific tools for each subagent. This part is not covered in this course, but you can check the details in the documentation.
